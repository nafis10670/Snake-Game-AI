# Teaching AI to play Snake using Reinforcement Learning
This is a project which I implemented from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJl4iabBEz0&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV">YouTube video</a>. Here, we teach an AI agent to play the snake games using Reinforcement Learning. The snake game is made using the **Pygame** module, and the AI agent is made using **PyTorch**. The video and the concept really interested me and I wanted to better understand how it works, and this led me to completing this project.

## How to run the project
Either clone the repository or download the project as a _.zip_ file. From the main project folder, run the _agent.py_ file to run the game. You can see the game running and the AI automatically begins to play the game. I used a graph to show that the AI agent improves its performance over time.
